'''
The size of the hash table is not determinate at the very beginning.
If the total size of keys is too large (e.g. size >= capacity / 10),
we should double the size of the hash table and rehash every keys.
Say you have a hash table looks like below:

size=3, capacity=4

[null, 21, 14, null]
       ↓    ↓
       9   null
       ↓
      null
The hash function is:

int hashcode(int key, int capacity) {
    return key  %  capacity;
}
here we have three numbers, 9, 14 and 21,
where 21 and 9 share the same position
as they all have the same hashcode 1 (21 % 4 = 9 % 4 = 1).
We store them in the hash table by linked list.

rehashing this hash table, double the capacity, you will get:

size=3, capacity=8

index:   0    1    2    3     4    5    6   7
hash : [null, 9, null, null, null, 21, 14, null]
Given the original hash table, return the new hash table after rehashing .

Notice

For negative integer in hash table, the position can be calculated as follow:

C++/Java: if you directly calculate -4 % 3 you will get -1.
You can use function: a % b = (a % b + b) % b to make it is a non negative integer.
Python: you can directly use -1 % 3, you will get 2 automatically.

Example
Given [null, 21->9->null, 14->null, null],

return [null, 9->null, null, null, null, 21->null, 14->null, null]
