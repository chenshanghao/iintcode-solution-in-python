'''
Given a knight in a chessboard (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier) with a source position,
find the shortest path to a destination position, return the length of the route.
Return -1 if knight can not reached.

Notice

source and destination must be empty.
Knight can not enter the barrier.

Clarification
If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

(x + 1, y + 2)
(x + 1, y - 2)
(x - 1, y + 2)
(x - 1, y - 2)
(x + 2, y + 1)
(x + 2, y - 1)
(x - 2, y + 1)
(x - 2, y - 1)
Example
[[0,0,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] return 2

[[0,1,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] return 6

[[0,1,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] return -1
